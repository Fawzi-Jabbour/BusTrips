#  Bus Ticket Reservation System

---

## 📌 Background

In 2026, while planning a trip to National City in my Country, I chose the most economical transportation option: the bus.

The reservation process exposed several systemic issues:

- Tickets could only be reserved physically at company offices.
- Trip schedules were not transparently published online.
- Reservations required advance in-person payment (typically 2 days prior).
- No clear return or refund policy.
- No visibility into:
  - Bus details (plate number, model, operator)
  - Seat selection
  - Safety-related information
- The customer received only:
  - Trip number
  - Departure time

For a transportation system operating in 2026, this workflow is operationally outdated and fails to meet modern usability, transparency, and safety standards.

As a junior software engineer, I identified this as a compelling real-world domain problem worth solving.

# 🚀 Project Overview

**Bus Ticket Reservation System** is a backend-focused transportation management platform designed to:

- Digitize bus trip scheduling
- Enable online reservations
- Provide seat selection
- Improve operational transparency
- Introduce structured refund policies
- Enhance safety traceability

This project serves two primary purposes:

1. Solve a practical transportation inefficiency.
2. Document my engineering journey from concept to production-ready architecture.
